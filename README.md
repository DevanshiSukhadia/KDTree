# KDTree

K-dimensional Tree is a data structure used for organizing number points in a
space with k-dimensions. It is a binary search tree that is very useful for range and
nearest neighbor searches. This project uses a 2-Dimensional K-D Tree. A non-leaf
node in K-D tree partitions into two parts, called as half-spaces. Points to the left of this
space are represented by the left subtree of that node and points to the right of the
space are represented by the right subtree.
